### Initial Ideas

### User stories

- As the user I want to be able to browse upto date content from the artist so that I can find links to their latest work

- As a new user I want a clear understanding of what the artist is about, as I will be using the website to redirect to other content.

- As the product owner I want to be able to update content easily as I am busy and wont have much time to delve into the code.

- As the product owner I want to consolidate my work so that It is easy for users to find as I am annoyed that everything is so disconnected.
